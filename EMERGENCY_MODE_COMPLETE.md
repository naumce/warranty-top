## 📊 Status Logic

### Smart Status Calculation:

```javascript
EXPIRED (daysLeft < 0):
├─ Color: Red
├─ Message: "Expired X days ago"
└─ Action: "Try anyway - they sometimes help!"

EXPIRES TODAY (daysLeft === 0):
├─ Color: Orange
├─ Message: "Last day of warranty!"
└─ Action: "FILE CLAIM IMMEDIATELY!"

URGENT (0 < daysLeft <= 7):
├─ Color: Orange
├─ Message: "X days left"
└─ Action: "Act fast - warranty ending soon!"

COVERED (daysLeft > 7):
├─ Color: Green
├─ Message: "X days left"
└─ Action: "You're covered! Contact support now."
